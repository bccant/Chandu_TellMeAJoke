# Chandu_TellMeAJoke
Java Joke acced via a GCP

This project builds upon the understanding of the following items:
 1. Creating a Java library from which the data is accessed by a Google Cloud Endpoint.
 2. The Android app accesses this endpoint to get the joke.
 3. This Joke would be displayed, when asked for a joke from the main landing page.
 
The app also offers two flavors: a paid and a free version. The free version displays ads.

The screenshot of the app are as below:
